## Overview

I glad I was able to give this challenge a shot. It really helped me to understand how to create navbars generally which I have been struggling with before now and also the drop down menus. In geeral, it was a realloy good experience trying this one out.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1)I started by trying to get the navbar woring,
2)Then I worked on the mobile view of the site.
3)Then I worked on its responsiveness, ensuring it looked good across all view ports
4)lastly, I worked on the dropdowns. I could have done this from the start, but I felt it might be difficult, and needing a whole lot of javascript codes to implement but suprisingly, it was'nt like I thougt.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

This was the first time I tried using sass in a project. Gave me a bit of confusion though bui I believe I'll get better with time.
Implementing the nav bar coupled with the dropdown menu was confusing at first as I have never done that before. This project gave me the knowledge on how to create these dropdons and even the nav menu itself.

### Continued development

I'd be looking to try implement this with react and the sass 7 1 architectural pattern... and also, with the way I implemented the navigation menu with js, id try do that using some other techniques.

just like I afore mentioned, I implemented the dropdown menus without and js(except for expanding the nav manu on mobile view), so i'd be looking to try implement the same thing using js this time around just to help strengthen my js skills.
